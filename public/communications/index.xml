      <description>U of T Engineering Students’ proposal for Ontario Building Code changes for Radon Gas. According to the World Health Organization, radon gas has become the second leading cause of lung cancer. In Ontario, high levels of radon can be found within Toronto’s GTA. Since there are no legal requirements in Ontario for radon testing, the currentOntario Building Code is inadequate to handle radon as a rising problem.The Canadian Environmental Law Association issued a report in November 2014 called Radon in Homes, Schools, and Workplaces: CELA Finds Legal Protections Lacking.</description>

      <description>Criminal Code – Prison Sentence: The effect of the Kazenelson criminal law decision on legal advice to workers. In concluding a case commentary in the previous issue of this newsletter, I asked: &amp;ldquo;Has Kazenelson changed the rules of engagement for going to work? Should workers worry about this?&amp;rdquo;
In this polemic, I try to explain why my answers are: yes &amp;amp; yes.
The Kazenelson case is the first major conviction under the Westray-changed Criminal Code.</description>
