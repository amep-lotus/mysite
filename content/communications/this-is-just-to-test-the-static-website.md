All We Want for Christmas is Fair Workers’ Comp! Injured Workers’ Holiday Outreach Blitz. Toronto: Meet at 11:30am at Yonge & Dundas Square \[Map\] Contact workerscompisaright@gmail.com for more information or visit the Facebook event page. On Monday December 11th, join us in communities across the province, to celebrate the strength and resilience of injured workers who refuse to back down from the struggle for fair compensation. The holiday season can be a difficult time for injured workers who have been forced into poverty because of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board’s focus on saving its own money by slashing compensation benefits.
